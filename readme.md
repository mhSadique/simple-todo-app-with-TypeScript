# This is an starter TypeScript project

### New things learned:

- You can create however many `.ts` files as you want, and, when you run, just `tsc` or `tsc --watch`, Typescript will create corresponding `.js` files for all the `.ts` files and it will create them inside the folders where the `.ts` files reside
